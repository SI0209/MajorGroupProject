Currently, Araf's Driving School operates using an old-fashioned manual system for managing lesson bookings and student records. This paper-based method creates additional admin work, making the process less efficient, time consuming and prone to errors.

Obtaining a driver's license is a key milestone for many, offering increased freedom and career opportunities. Driving schools like Araf's play an essential role in preparing learners with the skills and confidence needed to drive safely.

At present, all business operations such as booking and keeping track of learner information are done using paper. By implementing an information management system, Araf's Driving School could significantly improve efficiency and reduce the administrative burden. Additionally, learner data and other important details could be stored securely in a digital database, reducing reliance on physical records and enhancing overall data management.

At Araf's Driving School, they go beyond just offering a service â€“ they prioritize personalized attention for every learner. Their commitment to excellence ensures that everyone receives the focused guidance they need to succeed. Additionally, customer satisfaction is at the heart of their approach, ensuring that all learners leave with a positive experience.
